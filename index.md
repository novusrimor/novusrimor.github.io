Novus Rimor (Latin for "the new explorer") is a National Univeristy of Singapore (NUS) student-led initiative to build a competitive Mars Rover which will represent Singapore in a total of three big-time, exhilarating Mars rover challenges:
* [NASA's JPL Open Source Rover Project](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover)
* [The European Rover Challenge](http://roverchallenge.eu/)
* [The University Rover Challenge](http://urc.marssociety.org/)

As much as it is exciting, constructing a Mars rover is a massive undertaking, especially so since this marks our infant year as first-time competitors. We are starting from scratch and have nothing more to rely on than the sheer ability and willpower of our members. That is why we have gathered (and are still in the process of gathering) the best minds that NUS has to offer. So if you are a multi-systems person with just the right type of crazy, then join us by dropping your details over at novusrimor@gmail.com
